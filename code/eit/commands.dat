Commands file

There are 10 mandatory cards and 2 optional cards beginning with a #. 
The order of the cards has no importance.
Only lines beginnng with a # are considered by the C++ code.
If the characters following the # is the name of a card
(blank characters are ignored), the parameter on the next line is read,
for the 2 optional cards, the 2 parameters of the next lines are read.

* The card #dnmap
  Name of the data file giving the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
  The dnmap file should have Nd rows and Nd columns, where Nd=2*(nd+1)^2.

* The card #method
  Name of the method used for the reconstruction, it is either
  * calderon for a reconstruction with Calderón approximation.
  * texp for a reconstruction with texp approximation.
  * t0 for a reconstruction with t0 approximation.
  * t for a reconstruction with Nachman algorithm.

* The card #ift
  Name of the method used to compute Inverse Fourier Transform, it is either
  * ifft for an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform
  * ws for an inversion with the Whittaker-Shannon formula

* The card #ngrid
  Parameter for the grid where the scattering transform is computed
  * If the card #ift is ifft, ngrid is the
    Number of grid points for the scattering transform
    The scattering transform is computed for xi=ximaxonmo*(ii,jj,kk),
    where
    ximaxonmo = Pi*(ngrid-1)/(2*ngrid)
    -ngrid+1 <= ii,jj,kk <=ngrid-1
    ii+ngrid-1 ≡ 0 [2]
    jj+ngrid-1 ≡ 0 [2]
    kk+ngrid-1 ≡ 0 [2]
    Hence, the larger xi norm is sqrt(3)*Pi*(ngrid-1)^2/(2*ngrid).
  * If the card #ift is ws, ngrid is the
    Maximal integer for the computation of the scattering transform.
    The scattering transform is computed for xi=Pi*(ii,jj,kk),
    where -ngrid <= ii,jj,kk <=ngrid.
    Hence, the larger xi norm is sqrt(3)*Pi*ngrid.

* The card #zeta
  Method for the choice of zeta norm, it is either
  * fixed, in this case, the norm of zeta is the same for all grid points.
  * proportional, in this case, the norm of zeta is proportional to
    the norm of xi for each grid point.

* The card #pkappa
  Parameter for kappa, the norm of zeta/sqrt(2) (or equivalently,
  the norm of the real/imaginary part of zeta), which has to be
  used to compute the scattering transform.
  In the computation of the scattering transform, |zeta| has
  to be larger than |xi|/sqrt(2).
  * If the card #zeta is fixed, then the scattering transform
    is computed with the same fixed norm of zeta for all xi.
    kappa is given by
    * If #ift card is ifft
      kappa = pkappa*sqrt(3)*Pi*(ngrid-1)^2/(4*ngrid).
    * If #ift card is ws
      kappa = pkappa*sqrt(3)*Pi*ngrid/2.
  * If the card #zeta is proportional, then the scattering transform
    is computed with a norm of zeta proportional to the norm of xi for each xi.
    kappa is given by kappa = pkappa*|xi|/2.

* The card #mesh
  Name of the gmsh mesh file used to compute the reconstructed conductivity.

* The card #cgostraces
  Name of the file where to save the CGO solutions traces.

* The card #qhat
  Name of the file where to save the reconstructed Fourier Transform of q.

* The card #conductivity
  Name of the file where to save the reconstructed conductivity.

Optional cards

* The card #dnmap0
  Name of the file where to read or write the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
  for a conductivity equal to 1.
  * If the next line is "write", the C++ code saves the computed
    Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for a conductivity equal to 1
    in the file whose name is given in the following line.
  * If the next line is "read", the C++ code uses the
    Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for a conductivity equal to 1
    stored in the file whose name is given in the following line.

* The card #s0
  Name of the file where to read or write the Single Layer Operator Matrix.
  * If the next line is "write", the C++ code saves the computed
    Single Layer Operator Matrix in the file whose name is given
    in the following line.
  * If the next line is "read", the C++ code uses the
    Single Layer Operator Matrix stored in the file whose name is given
    in the following line.
