There are 3 mandatory cards, plus at least 1 mandatory #conductivity card
and 3 optional cards.
A #conductivity card contains 3 mandatory subcards.
The order of the cards has no importance as well as the order of the
subcards after the corresponding card and before the following card if any.
Only lines beginnng with a # are considered by the C++ code.
If the characters following the # is the name of a card
(blank characters are ignored), the parameters on the next lines are read.
If the card is a #conductivity card, until the next card,
only following lines beginnng with a ## are considered by the C++ code.
If the characters following the ## is the name of a subcard
(blank characters are ignored), the parameters on the next lines are read.

* The card(s) #conductivity
  There can be as many as one wants, for each #conductivity card,
  the subcards beginning with ## are read (blank characters are ignored
  and the order has no importance).
  Each #conductivity card gives the parameters of a radially symmetric
  C^\infty function sigma with compact support in the open unit ball.
  The support is then a ball of radius r < 1.
  If several #conductivity cards are given, the overall conductivity sigma
  is given by sigma = 1 + sum(sigma_i -1) where sigma_i are the conductivities
  given by each card. If the supports do not intersect, we then have
  q = sum q_i where
  q = Delta sigma^1/2 / sigma^1/2,
  q = Delta sigma_i^1/2 / sigma_i^1/2.

  The #conductivity contains 3 mandatory subcards:
    * The subcard ##radius
      The radius of the support.
    * The subcard ##amplitude
      The amplitude of the conductivity (real number).
    * The subcard ##innerextent
      Real number in the interval [0,1).
      Calling "r" the support radius, "sigmamax" the amplitude and "alpha"
      the inner extent, for 0 <= x²+y²+z² <= alpha²*r², the conductivity
      is equal to "sigmamax" and for alpha²*r² <= x²+y²+z² <= r²,
      the conductivity smoothly decreases to 1.

* The card #nd
  Maximal degree of spherical harmonics in the
  computation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
  The number Nd of quadrature points on the unit sphere
  is linked to this number by Nd=2*(nd+1)^2.

* The card #stepsize
  Stepsize in the discretization of the conductivity function.
  Note that some step sizes may be larger since there is no use to have
  discretization points where the conductivity function is constant.

* The card #dnmap
  Name of the file where to save of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
  The Dirichlet-to-Neumann is saved in the directory dnmap/.

Optional card

* The card #conductivityonradius
  Used to save the conductivity at points in [0,1].
  Useful to compare the conductivity and the one reconstructed by the
  inverse code.
  The next line is the stepsize of the discretization of [0,1]
  and the following one, the name of the file where to save the conductivity.

* The card #qonradius
  Used to save q at points in [0,1].
  Useful to compare q and the one reconstructed by the
  inverse code.
  The next line is the stepsize of the discretization of [0,1]
  and the following one, the name of the file where to save q.

* The card #dnmapeigenvalues
  Name of the file where to save the eigenvalues of the
  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
