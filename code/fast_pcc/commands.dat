There are 2 mandatory cards, plus at least 1 mandatory #conductivity card
and 1 optional card.
A #conductivity card contains either 4 mandatory subcards if it is
given in ball or 9 mandatory subcards if it is given by in a general ellipsoid.
The order of the cards has no importance as well as the order of the
subcards after the corresponding card and before the following card if any.
Only lines beginnng with a # are considered by the C++ code.
If the characters following the # is the name of a card
(blank characters are ignored), the parameters on the next lines are read.
If the card is a #conductivity card, until the next card,
only following lines beginnng with a ## are considered by the C++ code.
If the characters following the ## is the name of a subcard
(blank characters are ignored), the parameters on the next lines are read.

* The card(s) #conductivity
  There can be as many as one wants, for each #conductivity card,
  the subcards beginning with ## are read (blank characters are ignored
  and the order has no importance).
  Each #conductivity card gives the parameters of an homogeneous ellipsoid
  inclusion.
  For a function with general ellipsoidal shape,
  9 subcards have to be given:
    * The subcard ##center
      This card is followed by either "cartesian" or "spherical"
      and then by the coordinates of the center in the chosen
      coordinate system.
      The order of the cartesian coordinates is x y z.
      The order of the spherical coordinates is r theta phi, where
      0 <= r < 1 is the radial coordinate,
      0 <= theta <= 180 is the inclination angle in degrees,
      0 <= phi <= 360 is the azimuth angle in degrees.
    * The subcards ##axis1 ##axis2 ##axis3
      Each of these cards is followed by either "cartesian" or "spherical"
      and then by the coordinates of a direction vector. The 3 vectors
      have to be othogonal.
      The order of the cartesian coordinates is x y z.
      The order of the spherical coordinates is theta phi (no need of r), where
      0 <= theta <= 180 is the inclination angle in degrees,
      0 <= phi <= 360 is the azimuth angle in degrees.
    * The subcards ##radius1 ##radius2 ##radius3
      Each of these cards are respectively followed by the ellipsoid radii on
      respective axes ##axis1 ##axis2 ##axis3.
    * The subcard ##amplitude
      The amplitude of the conductivity (real number).
    * The subcard ##n
      2(n+1)² gives the number of quadrature points on the unit sphere.
      The quadrature integrates exactly spherical harmonics of degree less than
      or equal to n. These points are mapped onto the ellipsoid boundary.

  For sake of simplicity, if one wants a ball-shaped inclusion,
  the #conductivity cards can be given with 4 mandatory subcards:
    * The subcard ##center
      This card is followed by either "cartesian" or "spherical"
      and then by the coordinates of the center in the chosen
      coordinate system.
      The order of the cartesian coordinates is x y z.
      The order of the spherical coordinates is r theta phi, where
      0 <= r < 1 is the radial coordinate,
      0 <= theta <= 180 is the inclination angle in degrees,
      0 <= phi <= 360 is the azimuth angle in degrees.
    * The subcard ##radius (without any number)
      The radius of the ball.
    * The subcard ##amplitude
      The amplitude of the conductivity (real number).
    * The subcard ##n
      2(n+1)² gives the number of quadrature points on the unit sphere.
      The quadrature integrates exactly spherical harmonics of degree less than
      or equal to n. These points are mapped onto this sphere.

* The card #nd
  Maximal degree of spherical harmonics in the
  computation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
  The number Nd of quadrature points on the unit sphere
  is linked to this number by Nd=2*(nd+1)^2.

* The card #dnmap
  Name of the file where to save of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
  The Dirichlet-to-Neumann is saved in the directory dnmap/.

Optional card

* The card #conductivityonmesh
  Used to save the conductivity at points of a gmsh mesh.
  Useful to compare the conductivity and the one reconstructed by the
  inverse code which is computed at points of a gmsh mesh.
  The next line is the gmsh filename and the following one, the name
  of the file where to save the conductivity.
